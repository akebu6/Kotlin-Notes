# MutableList
+ MutableList is an ordered set of variables of the same type.
+ You can access the list items by their indexes.
```js
val numbers = mutableListOf(10.8, 14.3, 13.5, 12.1, 9.7) 

println(numbers) // [10.8, 14.3, 13.5, 12.1, 9.7]
```
+ you create a mutable list by using the `mutableListOf()` function
