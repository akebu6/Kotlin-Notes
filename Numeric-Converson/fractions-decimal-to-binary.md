Decimal to Binary Using Fractions
- the first step is to split the whole number from the fraction
- then carry out integer division on the whole part by 2 until you get to 0
- read the remainders in reverse arder and that makes the whole number of our partly converted decimal number
- next, multiply the fractional part by 2 and store the remainder until the fractional part becomes 0
- read the remainders in the same order (not in reverse order as with whole numbers)
- finally, combine both the whole number part and the fractional part.
