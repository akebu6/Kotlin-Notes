# Octal
> is a positional number system with a base of 88.

### Octal to decimal
each digit of the number is multiplied by 8 (which is, remember, the base of the octal system) raised to the power of its position in the number (from right to left, starting with 0).

### Decimal to octal
gotten by dividing the number by 8 and treating the remainder the same way as when dealing with decimal to binary
+ 1571 divided by 88 gives 7171 with a remainder of 33,
+ 71 divided by 88 gives 88 with a remainder of 77,
+ 8 divided by 88 gives 11 with a remainder of 00,
+ 1 divided by 88 gives 00 with a remainder of

### From binary to octal (and back again)
- done by grouping in groups of 3-bits
- each 3-bit is equal to one digit
