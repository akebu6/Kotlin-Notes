# What are data structures?
> are a way of organizing data and providing convenient access to it (CTDs: concrete data types)

- the term data structure refers to a collection of elements containing data, as well as relationships between them, and data operations.
- As a rule, data structures have two types of operations: internal, supporting data organization, and external, available to users for storing, retrieving, or modifying data.


### The role of data structures
- different data structures have different time complexities for performing the same external operations in a set of data

### Abstract data type
- an Abstract Data Type is a mathematical concept, a simpler and more abstract way to view the data structure as a whole. It is a data type that is defined by a set of values and a set of possible external operations (behavior) from the user's point of view
+ Abstraction — a concept in object-oriented programming; it "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information, a.k.a. abstract classes or interfaces;
+ Encapsulation — a method of making a complex system easier to handle for end users. The user needn't worry about the internal details and complexities of the system. Encapsulation is the process of wrapping the data and the code that operates on that data into a single entity.
