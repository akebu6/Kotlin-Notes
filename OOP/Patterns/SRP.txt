# Single Responsibility Principle
- demands that your programming unit should have only one reason to change (i.e. a single responsibility).

### God object
- is an object that knows too much or does too much.

### Responsibility boundaries
- The core of the principle is not about breaking the code into small isolated pieces. You gather what belongs to the same responsibility in one place, and then separate units with different responsibilities from each other.
