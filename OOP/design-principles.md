# Design Patterns
- Design principles are rules that guide you to better decisions for the design of your program.
- You can refer to them when you want to add or update any part of the code.
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): it's better to reuse code instead of copying it from one place to another
- You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI): is the principle of doing only the work that you need and not doing anything else.
- Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS): stands for making the code simpler for better understanding.
- GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) is a whole ecosystem with many design patterns included and mostly adhere to object-oriented programming.
