# Call Stack or Execution Stack Structure
> is composed of stack frames that store information about functions that have not yet terminated.
- The information includes the return address of a function, parameters, local variables, intermediate computations, and some other data.
- the call stack follows the rule Last In First Out (LIFO)
- A new stack frame is added when the execution enters the new function.
- And the stack frame is removed from the call stack if the execution of a function is done.
