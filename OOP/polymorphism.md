# Polymorphism
- is the ability of an object or its methods to take on many forms depending on its type and the parameters of this or that method. 
- The mechanism of defining several methods with the same name but with different parameters is known as overloading.

### Subtyping
- We override methods to extend or change their execution flow.

### Duck typing
- Duck typing term comes from the duck test reasoning "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck."
- In programming, if an object A has the same methods or attributes as an object B, we can say that the object A is a form of B.
- We can use duck typing in languages like Python or JavaScript, but not in Java or Scala.
