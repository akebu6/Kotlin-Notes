- The core class for file processing is File from the java.io package.

## readText
> helps you read the whole file in just one String variable.

- Say we create a text file reading.txt with the following text:
```
Kotlin or Java,
Java or C++.
```
- We put it in src folder, and now we can read it with our readText() method:
```
val fileName = "src/reading.txt"
val lines = File(fileName).readText()
print(lines)
```
- Instead of reading our file right away to a String variable, we can create a reference first and then read the text later:
```
val fileName = "src/new.txt"
val file = File(fileName)
val lines = file.readText()
print(lines)
```
- As you see, we made a mistake and tried to read a different file â€“ new.txt. If there is no such file in the filesystem, then `NoSuchFileException` is thrown.
- You can catch and process it as a usual Kotlin's exception, it's totally up to you. Now we can fix our example and continue:
```
val fileName = "src/reading.txt"
val file = File(fileName)
if (file.exists()) { // checks if file exists
    val lines = file.readText()
    print(lines)
} else print("No such file")
```
- Actually, our file variable didn't open the file, it just provided a reference with the path to it. 
- What's more, readText() automatically opened and closed the file!
- We can also provide specific charset for reading the file:
```
val line = File(fileName).readText(Charsets.US_ASCII)
```

**NOTE**
- keep it in mind that by default readText() has UTF-8 charset encoding, but you can change it whenever you want.
- Also, Kotlin doesn't recommend using this function with files larger than 2 Gb, because this may cause `OutOfMemoryError`.
- We can also check the existence of a file with `exists()` method, which will return false in case of a missing file and true if Kotlin found it
- Actually, you can use any method from File, for example, `length()` or `delete()`.

## readLines
> provides the functionality of reading files for each line and store it in List:

```js
val fileName = "src/reading.txt"
val lines = File(fileName).readLines()
for (line in lines){
    println(line)
}
```
- This method has the same size limitations and charset specification as readText().
