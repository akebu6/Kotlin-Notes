## Classes
> A class is another important notion of OOP. A class describes a common structure of similar objects: their fields and methods. It may be considered a template or a blueprint for similar objects. An object is an individual instance of a class.

- In accordance with the principle of encapsulation mentioned above, any class should be considered as a blackbox, that is, the user of the class should see and use only the interface part of the class, namely, the list of declared properties and methods, and should not delve into the internal implementation.
