# Working with Objects
> Objects are complex structures that can store some data and do something
+ it is a part of memory that stores some sort of information.
+ objects are made up of properties and member functions/methods

### Copying by reference
If you create a variable and assign an object to it, another variable can point to the same object as well.
```js
val msg1 = "Hi"
val msg2 = msg1
```
use the `=` to copy a reference of one object to another
