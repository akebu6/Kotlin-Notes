# Colours
- RGB is one possible way to represent a shade which is received as a combination of three basic colors: Red, Green, Blue. Using various degrees of saturation of the basic colors, you can get any shade. 
- It is described using numbers in the range from 0 to 255. 
- The black color is equivalent to the absence of this quality, therefore, its record will consist of their three zeros: `(0, 0, 0)`
- In order to get white, on the contrary, you need to make a combination of the maximum possible numbers: `(255, 255, 255)`
- Going beyond the minimum and maximum values, you can get other beautiful shades:

| name | RGB |

| oldLace | (253, 245, 230) |
| paleTurquoise| (175, 238, 238) |
| thistle | (216, 191, 216) |


# RGB and HEX
- Each RGB color can be represented in the hexadecimal system (HEX).
- It looks like this: `#RRGGBB`, where the first couple of digits is responsible for red, the second for green and the third for blue
