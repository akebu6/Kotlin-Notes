# Compile-time errors
> errors are errors that prevent a program to compile
these errors include:
+ syntax errors: incorrect keyword, typo, missing parenthesis or brace;
+ incorrect imported package name;
+ non-existing method invocation.

# Run-time errors (bugs)
> are errors that occur when the program is running
> 
Run-time errors will cause your program to behave unexpectedly or may even stop the execution.
These errors are classified into:
+ logic errors â€“ when a program produces a wrong result because the code is not correct (for example, instead of "Hello!", your program outputs "Hi!");
+ unhandled exceptions like division by zero, not found files, and other unexpected cases.
